              <b>Jute</b> is a natural fiber known as the "golden fiber" of Bangladesh, historically
              vital to the country’s economy and global trade. It is biodegradable, eco-friendly,
              and mainly used for making sacks, ropes, and mats.

            <p className="text">
              Cultivation of jute in the Bengal region dates back over <b>centuries</b>, with the
              industry thriving during the <b>British colonial era</b> in the 19th and early 20th
              centuries. At one point, Bangladesh was the world’s largest jute exporter.

              After the rise of <b>synthetic alternatives</b>, global demand for jute declined.
              However, growing awareness of environmental issues has led to a <b>revival</b> in
              recent years, making jute relevant once again in sustainable production.
