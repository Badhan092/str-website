              <b>Jute</b>, known as the "Golden Fiber," is a vital crop in Bangladesh, playing a key
              role in the economy and rural livelihoods. The country is one of the largest producers
              and exporters of jute and jute products, including bags, ropes, and carpets. Millions
              of farmers grow jute, and many work in jute mills and factories. It contributes
              significantly to export earnings and offers an eco-friendly alternative to plastic.
              With growing global demand for sustainable products, Bangladesh’s jute industry is
              gaining renewed importance. Historically and economically, jute remains a symbol of
              national pride and a pillar of rural development.
