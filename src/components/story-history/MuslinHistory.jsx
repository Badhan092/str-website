              <b>Muslin</b> is a legendary fabric that once brought global fame to Bengal, especially
              during the Mughal period. Woven from the finest cotton, it was so light and delicate
              it was called "woven air." Dhaka Muslin was treasured by royalty for its softness,
              transparency, and exquisite craftsmanship. Skilled weavers in Bengal, particularly in
              present-day Bangladesh, produced this fabric with great care and artistry. Though
              nearly lost to history, Muslin remains a proud symbol of our rich textile heritage.
              Our trading office is committed to honoring and reviving the timeless legacy of Muslin
              for the world to appreciate.
